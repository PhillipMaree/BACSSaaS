### Getting started

1. MOSIOP defines a MPC control law as applied for a particular test case defined in BOPTEST.

2. MOSIOP interfaces with BOPTEST via RESTful API. 

3. The BOPTEST OCP model is defined in **model.py**
4. The BOPTEST and MOSIOP configuration is combined, per test case, in **config.json**
5. BOPTEST and MOSIOP functionality is packaged respectively in **libboptest** and **lib** 

To run the simulation, run:
